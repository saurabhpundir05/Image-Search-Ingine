# Image-Search-EngineProject Description

The main features of the project include:

1. Search Form: The web page will include a search form with an input box where users can enter their desired keywords. This form will be responsible for triggering the image search.

2. Search Results: The search results section will dynamically display the retrieved images from the Unsplash API based on the user's search query. Initially, it will show 12 images, and the page will be cleared for each new search query.

3. Image Display: The search results will be presented as clickable image thumbnails. Each thumbnail will be a link to the high-resolution image on Unsplash, which will open in a new tab when clicked.

4. Pagination: To handle large result sets, a "Show More" button will be implemented. When clicked, it will load and display the next page of images from the Unsplash API.

5. Unsplash API Integration: The application will interact with the Unsplash API to fetch the images based on the user's search query. The API requests will include the access key for authentication.
